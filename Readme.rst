This is a collection of scripts for use in a linux-based system to
handle package management. It is also very silly.

To use, clone the repository somewhere and add it to your path (~/scripts works fine). Then, source distro_check.sh, and you can start using the scripts::

    ~$ git clone git://github.com/Qalthos/scripts.git
    ~$ export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts
    ~$ source scripts/distro_check.sh

If you want to use these scripts every time you open a terminal, simply add the last two lines to your ~/.bashrc (or similar file for your shell)
